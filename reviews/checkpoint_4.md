# Game Review - Checkpoint 4

## Game Title

### Review

The game has shown significant improvements since the last checkpoint. The integration of Flask has made the game more interactive and user-friendly. The game logic is well-implemented and the data schemas defined in the game models are efficient and effective.

The Flask routes and views defined in the game views file have made navigation through the game smooth and intuitive. The test cases in the game tests file have ensured that the game runs without any major bugs or errors.

The debugging code in the game debug file has been instrumental in identifying and fixing minor issues that cropped up during the testing phase. The installation guide provided clear and concise instructions on how to install the game, and the operation guide was helpful in understanding how to operate the game.

### Rating

At this stage of development, I would rate the game 80 out of 100. There is still room for improvement, but the game is shaping up to be a great experience for the users.

### Suggestions

For the next checkpoint, I would suggest focusing on improving the user interface and adding more interactive elements to the game. The game logic and models are solid, so the next step would be to enhance the user experience.

Looking forward to the next checkpoint!
