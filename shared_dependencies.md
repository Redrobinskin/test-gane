1. Flask: All the game code files will be using Flask, a Python web framework, for the backend.

2. Game Logic: The "game_logic.py" file will contain the core game logic which will be used by "main.py", "flask_app.py", "game_views.py", "game_models.py", "game_tests.py", and "game_debug.py".

3. Game Models: The "game_models.py" file will define the data schemas which will be used by "main.py", "flask_app.py", "game_views.py", "game_logic.py", "game_tests.py", and "game_debug.py".

4. Game Views: The "game_views.py" file will define the Flask routes and views which will be used by "main.py", "flask_app.py", "game_logic.py", "game_models.py", "game_tests.py", and "game_debug.py".

5. Game Tests: The "game_tests.py" file will contain the test cases for the game which will use the functions and variables from "main.py", "flask_app.py", "game_views.py", "game_logic.py", and "game_models.py".

6. Game Debug: The "game_debug.py" file will contain the debugging code for the game which will use the functions and variables from "main.py", "flask_app.py", "game_views.py", "game_logic.py", and "game_models.py".

7. Installation Guide: The "installation_guide.md" file will contain the instructions to install the game which will be based on the code in all the game code files.

8. Operation Guide: The "operation_guide.md" file will contain the instructions to operate the game which will be based on the code in all the game code files.

9. Reviews: The "checkpoint_x.md" files will contain the reviews of the game at different stages of development. They will be based on the game's state at each checkpoint, which is determined by the code in all the game code files.

10. Markdown: All the documentation and review files will be written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language.

11. Loop Iteration: The loop iteration variable 'x' will be used to name the review files and will be shared across all the review files.
